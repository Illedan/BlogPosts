# Brain Rules for Baby

This collection of notes will explain parts of the book I found useful and funny, I haven't fact checked the science used as grounds for the reasons in the book, but the reader of this post could apply some criticism or enjoy it as is. Please let me know if I got some parts wrong or there is good contradicting science, I'm just glad to learn :) And I highly recommend parents or soon to be parent to read this book.

The book is about the development of a baby brain and how a parent could act in various situations occurring during the life of a parent. 

## Time before birth

When the mom throws up (morning sickness) it could result in smarter babies, because she isn't do anything too fancy and taking fewer risks. This makes the mom and the baby more "secure" and the mom usually relaxes more when feeling nauseous giving the baby brain more room to grow. 

## TV and Games

Research shows that any kind of screen before the age of 2 gives no value. And there is no proven software or program to boost the kid intellect. After the age of 2 it should be with an educational eye and with interactions, such as mimicking or talking about what is seen on screen, but it shouldn't be too much screen time until the age of 5, no matter the content. Learning a word from a tv show or sound book will not boost the vocabulary of the child, as it needs to be spoken from a human to reveal the proper micro expressions. 

## Rules

A kid screaming at a store because it can't get candy is never a pleasant view. An often response is trying to stop the embarrassment, thought this might only create a worse situation. A better response is to acknowledge the feeling and explaining why he/she feels that way. Talking about the reasons for a particular event or rule helps to underline why the rule exists, nobody likes to be forced into actions without proper reasoning. Often a kid might do unwanted behavior, like throwing books down the stairs, this is mostly attention seeking and could be ignored unless a known rule is broken, while one should praise a child following a rule. The last part is as important as giving response to a broken rule.

## Happiness and feelings

Explaining a given situation and giving reasons to it, helps a child to learn more empathy. An example is to narrate why random people around have various visible feelings as it boost understanding of other people. Another option is to role play, creating a creative atmosphere for the child to explore other ideas or thought patterns. Talk about feelings, explain how something feels and why. There is no bad feeling, just a feeling. If the kid doesn't know what it feels, it helps to explain that it might have that particular feeling right now. Learning music before the age of 6 might enhance emphatic skills as a child might learn to understand and distinguish signs and sounds better. 
Empathy helps a person in keeping friendship as one understands better how to react to various situations, making other people feel seen.

## Progress

Just memorizing maths might not be the best way to go about understanding math. Knowing why something, is better than knowing what, because you can deduce the knowledge again, even if you forget the actual result. Like learning multiplication only by memorizing the multiplication-table. Praise progress and not results, a good progress will give good results in the end.
Learning to Filter out noise is a known factor for higher IQ, as it helps in concentration when learning/reading.
