# Turning the ship around

This book is about applying the Leader Leader structure, in opposed to Leader Follower structure throughout an organization, while using a Nuclear submarine as an example. The book explains principles with great examples from making a submarine achieve high excellence in all ranks.

I recommend this book due to the excellent submarine story and great details from the example used to present this model.

## Leader Leader

This model is structured to make everyone in command. Instead of a leader applying his/her plan, everyone should have a word. This keeps crew/employees focused and interested in the whole operation and not only what their leader order them to do. Do you take control or give control?

## Information

Move authority to information and instruct people to do deliberate actions, where they say "I intend to do" or "I'm going to do". This enables creativity in the workers and the leader only have to accept/deny their request. Others might also join in to discuss the spoken plan, in case something doesn't add up. Once employees have worked up their own way of thinking, they can act independently in critical situations. This also results in more people understanding the action about to happen, as a Leader giving instructions doesn't make the worker understand why actions are applied, as they are just blindly doing as told.

## Errors

If you focus too much on errors, people will focus on reducing errors rather than achieving excellence. But you can never stop all errors, people are human and human makes mistakes, they can only be reduced or controlled before happening. This is why praising to Reporting errors to learn from them is brilliant. An error occurs due to a broken system, it's better to fix the system than battle the error itself, most people intend to positive actions.

## Learning

Make goals for everyone and create processes to enhance their skills, aim for the long term not only the short term. If you enhance learning instead of teaching, people gain information where needed and have an open mind with willingness to learn. Add some measurements to this and you can utilize the power of gamification to motivate everyone.
